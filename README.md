Node.js Blog API with User and Post Management

This project is a powerful and scalable Node.js-based Blog API that provides robust functionalities for user registration, login, user management, post management, and category management. The API serves as a solid foundation for building a feature-rich blogging platform or content management system (CMS).

Key Features:

User Registration and Login: Users can easily register an account with the API and securely log in using their credentials. Passwords are encrypted using industry-standard hashing algorithms to ensure maximum security.

User Management: The API provides endpoints to manage users, including updating user profiles, changing passwords, and deleting accounts. It allows administrators to control user roles and permissions.

Post Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts using the API. Each post includes essential details such as title, content, author, category, and timestamps.

Category Management: Categories help organize blog posts, making it easy for users to find content related to specific topics. The API supports creating, updating, and deleting categories for effective content organization.

Token-Based Authentication: The API implements token-based authentication (JWT - JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure and stateless communication between the client and the server. Tokens are used for user authentication and authorization.

Validation and Error Handling: Robust input validation and error handling are integrated into the API, ensuring that client-side requests are validated before processing and meaningful error responses are provided when issues occur.

Middleware and Authorization: Middleware functions are utilized to handle common tasks like authentication, role-based access control, and logging, providing a modular and efficient way to manage request flow.
